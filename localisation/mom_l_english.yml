 # House Divided Localisation
 origin_mom_house_divided:0 "A House Divided"
 origin_mom_house_divided_desc:0 "This society went through a major crisis during its early expansion. With its first colonies settled and developed, and its vision outward bound for the next step into the endless void, treachery hit them unprepared when one colony declared its independence. With their weakness and inability to react now laid bare for all to see, their other colony soon seized upon the opportunity to revolt as well."
 origin_tooltip_mom_house_divided_effects:0 "Start out neighbouring two other empires of your own species."
 origin_mom_house_divided_splinter_colony:0 "Splinter Colony"
 origin_mom_house_divided_splinter_colony_desc:0 "This society started out as colonists under their mother nation. Whether it was perceived oppression, political opportunism or simply a strong will to forge its own destiny, this former colony renounced its homeworld's administration and declared independence."
 START_SCREEN_MOM_HOUSE_DIVIDED:0 "Since the earliest times, our people reached for ever greater goals. We fought wild beasts, tamed the lands, built great cities and spread across our world.\nEventually with the invention of hyperdive technology we went on to reach for the stars. During our early expansion small colonies grew to become new homes for our people and a foundation for what was to come. Yet as our eyes lay on the endless sea of the void with worlds just waiting to be claimed, we were betrayed. With our military unprepared for such an event, we could only watch as our colonies declared themselves independent, shattering our plans. We have been in a state of cold war with them ever since. But this madness will end now.\n\nA house divided cannot stand. Unity must be achieved, be it by diplomacy or military force. We will not be denied our destiny!"
 mom_house_divided_system_NAME:0 "A House Divided"
 mom_house_divided_system_DESC:0 "An ordinary start in an unary solar system."

 # Severance Localisation
 origin_mom_severance:0 "Severance"
 origin_mom_severance_desc:0 "Prior to discovering the hyperlane network, this civilization found a wormhole within its homesystem, managing to establish an outpost on the other side. Unfortunately, it turned unstable shortly after and manned travel through it became too dangerous, separating homeworld and colony."
 origin_tooltip_mom_severance_effects:0 "Begin with a wormhole in your homesystem, a colony on the other side, but no means to safely travel through it."
 START_SCREEN_MOM_SEVERANCE:0 "Our civilization prospered on [GetHomeWorldName] for a long time, but our people always felt that our destiny lay out there in the void. Early space exploration limited to our homesystem by primitive STL-drives had yielded an extraordinary discovery. A wormhole connected our system to another further away than we could ever hope to reach by conventional means. Scouts where sent, followed by a colony ship heading for a planet now known as [event_target:mom_severance_colony.GetName]. It was a dream come true, though as any dream it didn't last.\n\nThe wormhole became unstable shortly after our colony's founding. Experts still debate whether it was ever stable, to begin with, or we'd just been lucky. Many lives were lost, when another wave of colonists failed to reach the other side and further manned travel through it was deemed too dangerous. However, communication was still possible, but supplies sent through it had only a 30% expectancy to reach their destination. This separation left us in a precarious situation.\n\nBut now, after the discovery of the hyperlane network, the finest minds of the [GetName] have finished development of the first hyper drives. We are finally able to reach other stars and hopefully our colony as well."
 
 # Breakaway Civilization
 origin_mom_breakaway_civ:0 "Breakaway Civilization"
 origin_mom_breakaway_civ_desc:0 "Still fractured into various nation states this civilization made its first steps on the way to become spacefaring after the discovery of an ancient alien wreckage. Unbeknownst by its rivals or even its own population one of the worlds superpowers began reverse engineering the alien technology in secrecy."
 origin_tooltip_mom_breakaway_civ_effects:0 "Begin with fewer pops but the potential of planetary unification, which if achieved provides access to the workforce and natural resources of the other nation states.\nBeware the looming threat of nuclear war and try to ease the tensions...\nOr face the consequences of your mistakes..."
 START_SCREEN_MOM_BREAKAWAY_CIV:0 "[GetHomeWorldName] is a fractured world - divided between various super powers. Wars dominated our history, but the splitting of the atom and its derived weapons of mass destruction changed everything.\n\nThough major conflicts have ceased under the threat of mutually assured destruction, we are living in a state of cold war and tensions are higher than ever before.\n\nBut even in these trying times we have been blessed with good fortune. A discovery has been made in a desolate and only sparsely populated area under our dominion - a strange vessel which must have crashed there ages ago. Scientists believe it to be of alien origin and having once been capable of interstellar travel. Thanks to the remote location of this finding we were able to keep it a secret not only from the broad puplic but also from our rivals.\n\nToday we will reap the fruits of years of development and research and clandestine operations to establish outposts in our solar system. The [GetName] might not know it yet, but future history books will speak of this day as the beginning of a new age as we send out our first explorational vessel to another star."
